                In December 2017, I was in an accident. Again, in early 2018. I have post traumatic stress. I haven't been the same person since then. For that last two years, my family doctor desperately attempted to use <em>"modern"</em> medicine to treat what I was experiencing. To keep a long, depressing story short; her attempts to make me better only made it worse. Her decisions to keep me alive were directing me towards my grave. A terrifying concept. Needless to say, I'm with a new family doctor, but his focus is not my mental health, his focus is on my heart. I'm not trying to reveal too much, but I do want to illustrate how difficult normal life became for me after these accidents happened.

                To cope with the symptoms I was experiencing, I couldn't work, unless it was to help my parents with something around the house. While at home, I would watch hours and hours of podcasts to escape my own thoughts. One day, while watching <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/joerogan/videos" target="_blank">The Joe Rogan Experience</a>, I stumbled across a video with him and a dude named <a class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Stamets" target="_blank">Paul Stamets</a>, and to make a long story short, he introduced me to the concept of microdosing psilocybe mushrooms. He told stories of miracles. I thought to myself, even if what he is saying is 1% true, <a class="links" href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/breakthrough-therapy" target="_blank">the benefits are still unheard of medically</a>.

                Since I started taking the medical mushrooms. My life has started to turn around. I still have a long, hard, unsure road ahead of me, but the mushrooms have given me hope. They have also given me a general sense of peace that I didn't have before I started taking them. My parents, whom are my main support system, I'm incredibly fortunate to have them as parents, have also noticed a difference just in how I interact with them. The website that I use to get this medicine is <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://mushroomdispensary.com/">The Mushroom Dispensary</a>. I'm not saying that this is for everyone, although the data might suggest that, but I think that it is definitely something that people might be interested in. Even for the healthiest of minds, right now is a stressful time for the human experience.
